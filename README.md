Important!!!!!

next to the existing file paths (there are 2, one for resources in the main project folder and one for direct file creation in the debug build folder) make a file path of your own that works on your computer and comment out the other file paths. DO NOT DELETE OTHERS as i don't want to spend half an hour searching for where this file should go again.
